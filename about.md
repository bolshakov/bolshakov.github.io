I'm TÃ«ma Bolshakov, a software engineer building and scaling software systems every day. Throughout my career, 
I've worked across various domains and technologies, learning lessons that I believe are worth sharing.

This blog is where I document my thoughts on software architecture, development practices, and the technical decisions 
that shape how we build software. You'll find posts about the problems I've encountered, the solutions I've 
implemented, and the insights I've gained along the way.
